# how to sort? just by what I wanty to emphasize maybe, or time? recent to oldest?


#  * recent voice assistant research, exploration, and prototype creation. researched alexa, google assistant approaches. combined with our research on questions that cliniciians
#    would wnat to ask an assistant. in order to get the best understanding for the effectivness and design direction of such an assistant
#    I trained a voice intent parser to recognize the various questions we wanted to include. Thinking though all of the utterances needed for
#    each question also helps us document it for development. refined the utterances based on our natural interaction with the assistant,
#    adding new utterances that felt natural in a conversational context and modifying existing ones.  The intent parser used the Snips NLU open
#    source library, written in Python, and so I created a Django Web API that exposed our intent parser as web API calls.  An angular application
#    I wrote (look in directory speech-recognition-demo) used the Web Voice API for voice recognition, which sent the users speech to the Django API for parsing. The patient data was obtained
#   from teh patient data generator that I also created. This all allowed for a very realistic interaction with our voice assistant designs
#   and allowed us to determine what felt most natural in that conversational context, because that experience sis very difficult to design an d prototype
#   using traditional UI design tools.



#  relationships builder for clinicians.  idea for clinicians to create their own clinical relationships from parts of the patient record such as
#  medication and problem associations.
#  would combine an automated relationship builder that the EHR could create for the user, while still allowing the user to also add
#  their own releationships manually. see directory clinical-connections in webstorm-projects

#
# update starter kit: new thumbnail and description, include that I did snippets and stackblitz examples illustrating how to code certain designs that the UX team commonly proposes.


# yaml NOTE: to include a multi line string use the "block chomping indicator" (>-), which will allow you to break a field value
#  across multiple lines, and will eliminate the trailing line break in the parsed value


# include visual tags on each card: design, development, data visualization, research, statistical analyses

    A graphical design concept that I invented to represent very complex boolean flows in an understandable fashion.
    This concept was used in a design for clinical decision support rules, in which many combinations of problems, medications,
    allergies, etc. formed a clincal rule to determine a patient's eligibility or need.

  title: Health Dials

    Health dials are a design concept I created to facilitate quick, automatic interpretation of clinical metrics.  The
    visual concept is based on research in aviation, in which the researchers wanted a display that was as quickly
    and automatically processed as possible.  Health dials could be used in situations where quick and accurate interpretation
    is needed at a glance, such as in surgical settings, or even non-critical situations such as viewing lab results.

    Web API that will generate any number of sections of a patient record, as json data.  Various profiles
    are supported based on primary disease. For example, a hypertension patient will show the correct ranges of vital
    sign values, medications, and problems for a hypertension patient. Extensible so that any number of profiles can
    be defined very easily in standard yaml files. Written in Swift using the Vapor framework.

      created UI designs in Sketch, created the client application in Angular, and created the back end as an web API in Swift running on Ubuntu Linux.

  description: >-
    Uses the Abstract SDK to pull graphical assets directly from Abstract project files. I created Node.js scripts that
    can automatically transform those raw assets into a custom web font or create .png files needed for mobile applications. Final
    assets are then automatically pushed to a git repository that developers would access.  This greatly facilitates
    how developers obtain the assets for a project.
