# maimonodes obs notes,
# * Somehow include working examples of my power BI work, maybe by including hard-coded json data.
# Creation of data visualization guidelines across the company
# * My ux patent layout and interaction
# * include the project 'intersection diagram', which is a comorbidity explorer, a unique way of seeing relationships in data
# * homecare mobile write up for usability testing,
# * clinical risk asssessment application; describe how I created the full stack for that: initial user research, design concepts, how to transform the existing excel spreadsheet into a ui, the front end and back end architecture, and all of the coding and deployment.
# update starter kit: new thumbnail and description, include that I did snippets and stackblitz examples illustrating how to code certain designs that the UX team commonly proposes.

  title: Internal Web Application for Clinical Risk Cases
  description: >-
    I transformed a confusing process into a web application for
    tracking the potential clinical risk items.  I gathered business requirements, interviewed a users,
    created UI designs in Sketch, created the client application in Angular, and created the back end as an web API in Swift.

  title: Water Valve Charts
  description: A graphical design concept that I invented to represent very complex boolean flows in an understandable fashion.
  extendedDescription: >-
    This concept was used in a design for clinical decision support rules, in which many combinations of problems, medications,
    allergies, etc. formed a clincal rule to determine a patient's eligibility or need.

  title: Health Dials
  description: >-
    Health dials are a design concept I created to facilitate quick, automatic interpretation of clinical metrics.  The
    visual concept is based on research in aviation, in which the researchers wanted a display that was as quickly
    and automatically processed as possible.  Health dials could be used in situations where quick and accurate interpretation
    is needed at a glance, such as in surgical settings, or even non-critical situations such as viewing lab results.

  title: Patient record generator and clinical note search tool.
  description: >-
    Web API that will generate any number of sections of a patient record, as json data.  Various profiles
    are supported based on primary disease. For example, a hypertension patient will show the correct ranges of vital
    sign values, medications, and problems for a hypertension patient. Extensible so that any number of profiles can
    be defined very easily in standard yaml files. Written in Swift using the Vapor framework.

- title: Graphical Asset Generator
  description: >-
    Uses the Abstract SDK to pull graphical assets directly from Abstract project files. I created Node.js scripts that
    can automatically transform those raw assets into a custom web font or create .png files needed for mobile applications. Final
    assets are then automatically pushed to a git repository that developers would access.  This greatly facilitates
    how developers obtain the assets for a project.

- title: Click it, Capture it, Cogulator extension
  description: >-
    A MacOS application written in Swift that monitors global mouse clicks in the background and generates a Cogulator script
    containing all of the needed mouse coordinates and response times for a Cogulator model.  Cogulator is a fairly general
    application, and I created this 'click it, capture it' application to automatically create a Cogulator script based on
    UI interaction.

This design is an attempt to support clinical needs for sepsis by helping clinicians understand what has been done and what needs to be done next in a time-critical sepsis situation.
