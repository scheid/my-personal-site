  <p>Welcome. My name is Todd Eischeid.</p>

  <p>There are many words I would use to describe myself: experimental psychologist, designer, developer, inventor, musician.  And I enjoy myself
    when I can combine these into whatever I'm doing. An ideal job would combine my creativity, expertise in human cognition, design skills, and my software development skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    I naturally think in terms of novel and creative solutions to problems, and I enjoy building solutions that I create.
  </p><p>

  Understanding users' jobs and creating designs that minimize cognitive friction, getting them as close as possible to the essence of their work.
  A user experience that balances enjoyment with inconspicuousness.
</p>
  <p>
    A unique skill set that encompasses scientific research, design, and technical development: starting with user and business requirements gathering,
    user field research, design ideation, creation of working software prototypes, usability testing, and contribution to the final production code.
