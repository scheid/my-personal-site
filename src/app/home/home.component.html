  <p>Welcome. My name is Todd Eischeid.</p>

  <p>There are many words I would use to describe myself: experimental psychologist, designer, developer, inventor, musician.  And I enjoy myself
    when I can combine these into whatever I'm doing. An ideal job would combine my creativity, expertise in human cognition, design skills, and my software development skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    I naturally think in terms of novel and creative solutions to problems, and I enjoy building
    the solutions that I create.
  </p><p>
  I find it invaluable to talk directly with users of products to understand their jobs and then create designs that get users closer to the
  essence of their work.  The ideal user experience should balance enjoyment with inconspicuousness.
</p>
  <p>
    My unique contribution to a team is a skill set that encompasses the scientific research, artistic design and technical development process: initial user requirements gathering,
    user field research, creation of working software prototypes, usability testing, and contribution to the final production code.
  </p>
