<p>The CareQuality application was a new product for internal configuration and management of
customers on the <a href="https://carequality.org/">CareQuality network</a>.
</p>

  <p>My role on this was the UI design of all parts of the CareQuality application; the user interface
    was to be written in Angular.  You can view my UI designs using the buttons above.</p>

<p>The development team chose to use the <a href="javascript:void(0)" [routerLink]="'/starter-kit'">UI Starter Kit</a>  that I created. As this was the first team that I worked closely with on the starter kit, I learned how a team would actually
use the kit in a product. So, in parallel with the UI design work I was doing, I was also improving and streamlining
  the UI Starter Kit to better fit developers' usage of it. </p>
