<p>The CareQuality application was a new product for internal configuration and management of
customers on the <a href="https://carequality.org/">CareQuality network</a>.
</p>

<p>The development team chose to use the UI starter kit that I created and that I also maintain.</p>

<p>As this was the first team that I worked closely with on the starter kit, I learned of the ways that a team would actually
use the kit in a product.  I tailored the starter kit to be more streamlined with UI development. For example, bugs are
inevitable, and getting an update to the development team should be as seamless as possible. </p>
