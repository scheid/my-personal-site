      <h3>Know Your Users</h3>

      <div>
      <p>The first and foremost question that I bring to any
        design: Who is using it? What is their job day-to-day, week-to-week?</p>

      <p>No design is built in a vacuum with the requirement of just being "usable".  It needs to fit the job and tasks of specific people who use it.
        Extensive user research should be the foundation of any design effort.</p>

      <h3>Understand Human Behavior</h3>

      <div class="d-none d-md-block" style="float:right; clear:right"><img src="./assets/images/IMG_1990_smaller-2.jpg" style="width: 90%;max-width: 330px;border: 3px solid #ffffff;margin:15px;border-radius:10px"/></div>
      <div class="d-block d-md-none" style="text-align: center"><img src="./assets/images/IMG_1990_smaller-2.jpg" style="width: 90%;max-width: 330px;border: 3px solid #ffffff;margin:15px;border-radius:10px"/></div>

      <div>
        <p>As the image to the right illustrates, understanding the motivations of your users is
          imperative, as sometimes, no amount of documentation, training, or signage would overcome a poorly informed
          design.
          We should seek to understand human capabilities and limitations; understand
          how people tend to act in certain situations, regardless of their training.
        </p>
        <p>The picture below was taken at a park near my house, and I have always thought it such a great example of the importance of
          understanding users and human cognition in general when designing. The sign clearly states "Keep Off Slope", however, people walk right on by the sign to climb the hill. Why is that?
        What is the cognitive cost-benefit analysis that the person is unconsciously doing? What type of approach, beyond signage, would truly deter people from walking up the slope?
        </p>



        <p>This psychological aspect of design is most interesting to me, which is why I pursued my doctorate in Human Factors Psychology.</p>

      <h3>Information, Not Data</h3>
      <div>
    <p>
      Information is that which reduces uncertainty.  Data needs to be digested by the user in order to turn it
      into information. And so, the more information we can give users, the less cognitive burden we place on them.</p>

        <p>And knowing what constitutes information requires a thorough understanding of users. </p>
        <!--
        <p>A mental exercise that helps me is to anthropomorphize the software system as the user's personal human assistant, and
      think of what would be expected of the assistant. The user would expect that the assistant provide them information,
      not just data. If an assistant handed the user a spreadsheet full of numbers, the assistant wouldn't really be doing his or her job.
      If, on the other hand, the assistant handed the user a summarized report containing an intelligent interpretation of that same grid of numbers,
      that would benefit the user much more.  Too many applications give the user data in some visually appealing way, and mistake that for helpful information.

          <h3 >Corvettes and Socket Wrenches</h3>
          <div>

            <p>I use these two as metaphors for software intended for pleasure and entertainment vs. software that
              should be more of a transparent tool.</p>
    <p>
      Don't try to build "Corvette" for your users when what they really need is a "socket wrench".  And vice-versa!
      Know when you are building Corvettes and when you are building socket wrenches.  The main difference here
      is in the user needs. If the user has specific and specialized needs, and the
      goal is to optimize efficiency, that is more along the
      lines of a socket wrench.  In other words, the user should not be thinking explicitly about the product; it is a tool
      that helps them get the job done, and tries to stay out of their way.

    </p>

            <!--
            <p>Imagine if a car mechanic had to call up tech support when something
      went wrong with one of his socket wrenches, because he could not figure out why the wrench stopped working.
      Sounds ridiculous, I know, and oversimplifies software development,
      but this is how users want the software to fit into their work or life: they want to get their task done
      without thinking about the software itself.  The "delighter" with this kind of approach will come over time
      when the user reflects on it and realizes that it just works all of the time.

      <h3 >Less user interface</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          I believe that the ultimate goal of helping users do their jobs involves a reduction of user interfaces, not creating
          new ones or even optimizing existing ones. The long-term goal of UX
          should be to create smart systems that act more like intelligent assistants, removing repetitive and error prone tasks from the user.
        </p>
        <p>
        Know when a user interface is not appropriate for the current task: sometimes a user interface, either visual or auditory, can add cognitive friction.
        Know when less UI would be more helpful to the user. The focus is on the UX not the UI.
        </p>
        <p>
        As designers, we might forget that user interfaces are not inherently part of jobs in which they are used. Computers and mobile devices are peripheral to jobs;
        they augment the essence of a job.
        Ideally, UX would add as little as possible to a user's job, while helping them be efficient, gain new insights, be less stressed, and commit fewer errors.

      <h3>Be Pragmatic</h3>
      <div>

<!--
    <p>I try to avoid being a purist when it comes to design or implementation approaches.  If the purist approach was a winning one,
      then JavaScript would not even exist, not to mention powering all of today's web sites and apps. (good article <a href="http://www.doc4design.com/articles/still-writing-javascript/">here</a> )
      This is not to say don't have high standards, you should fight for doings things the right way, but know when to compromise in order to get the job done.
    </p>
  -->
    <p>Every design should be weighed against the skill and experience of the development
      team that will be implementing it, the company culture, the user culture (which may or may not welcome changes/improvements,
      or would welcome them but be constrained in how they can adopt changes) the project funding, and the technologies that the
      development team is using.
    </p>
<!--
    <p>
      A design cannot exist independent of the current state of technology.
      Creating a design without thinking about the technological constraints often results in that design not being realized correctly. And the
      ideal design almost never gracefully degrades when your environment doesn't allow that design to be implemented.  I do think as
      part of the very early design process, that the designers should create designs that they believe to be the ideal, free of any constraints.
      But that is a first step. Then it is the designers who should evaluate that 'perfect' design against how it would be implemented and
      adjust the design accordingly.  Do not provide the 'perfect' design to development and rely on them to adjust your design, as they
      often are not thinking about the UX implications of such changes.   In fact, the end product that you as the designer create, after
      iterating on the ideal, should be tailored to the constraints of the technologies that the product will be developed in.

      <h3 >Clicks</h3>
      <div>
    <p>When creating designs, I tend not to use the number of clicks, panels, or screens as usability metrics.
      Instead, I focus on users' comprehension of the task flow, and the ease with which they can accomplish their goals.
      To me, click counting is akin to saying you should take the shortest route to get to the store, when that route is known to
      be confusing to navigate and doesnâ€™t have paved roads.   A safer, more efficient, and even enjoyable route has paved roads, good road signs,
      and is longer, but would be missed if the focus is solely on the shortest route.
