<p>I maintain a public NPM package for the data synthesizer, which can be found at: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-synthesizer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/data-synthesizer</a></p>

<p>The data synthesizer is an Angular service that can randomly generate large, hierarchical data sets in real time.  The data generation is highly and easily configurable, and very fast, using a Web Assembly module that I developed for random number generation.</p>


<p>Adding realistic data to a design (e.g., from usage analytics or subject matter experts) can either help to validate the designs or highlight where the designs need improvement.
  Often it is prohibitive to create the data manually, and inefficient to hard code it into a Sketch or Figma drawing.
  Creating prototypes in Angular combined with the data synthesizer allows me to very easily add realistic data to scale and test the design.

<p>I decided that others could find this useful as well, and so I now maintain it on the NPM repository.</p>
